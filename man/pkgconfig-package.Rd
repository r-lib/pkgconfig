\title{Persistent configuration for R packages}
\description{
This package is meant to be used in other packages, and provides
configuration options for them.
}
\details{
It is currently very minimal, and has two main functions: one
for setting configuration options (\code{\link{set_config}}), and one
for querying them (\code{\link{get_config}}).
}
